# Cyrcle

A nice circular visualisation. I plan on animating and adding the control panel when time permits. Refresh the page (F5) to see different render.

# Letter

A letter made of letters/symbols. Press any key and change paramaters to see different letter visuals (I recommend Webdings). Sometimes switching to another windows is required to take effect.
In the future I'd like to animate it as well. 

# Zaluzie

My first animated project, creates movements according to a noise pattern (Perlin noise) on a fixed grid. Play with the tweakpane to achieve interesting results.
